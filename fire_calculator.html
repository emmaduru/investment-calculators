      <h1 id="fire-article" class="mb-4">The Complete Guide to FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)</h1>
      <p class="lead">FIRE, or Financial Independence, Retire Early, is a strategy that allows individuals to achieve financial freedom and potentially retire decades earlier than the traditional retirement age. This guide explores the principles, formulas, strategies, and practical steps to achieve FIRE, along with common questions and considerations.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- What is FIRE -->
    <section aria-labelledby="what-is-fire" class="mb-5">
      <h2 id="what-is-fire">What is FIRE?</h2>
      <p>FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It is a financial movement that encourages aggressive saving and investing to achieve financial independence well before the traditional retirement age. The concept revolves around accumulating a sufficient investment portfolio that generates enough passive income to cover your living expenses indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional retirement planning, which relies on working until 65 or 70, FIRE emphasizes maximizing savings rate, minimizing unnecessary expenses, and leveraging compound growth in investments. Many FIRE enthusiasts aim for a <strong>50% or higher savings rate</strong> to reach their goals faster.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- FIRE Formula -->
    <section aria-labelledby="fire-formula" class="mb-5">
      <h2 id="fire-formula">The FIRE Formula</h2>
      <p>The fundamental calculation for achieving FIRE involves determining the investment portfolio required to sustain your desired lifestyle indefinitely. The core formula is based on the <strong>4% safe withdrawal rule</strong>:</p>

      <!-- MathML Formula -->
      <figure class="mb-3" aria-label="FIRE Portfolio Calculation Formula">
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
          <mi>Portfolio</mi>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mi>Annual Expenses</mi>
          <mo>/</mo>
          <mn>0.04</mn>
        </math>
        <figcaption class="text-muted">Portfolio = Annual Expenses ÷ Safe Withdrawal Rate (4%)</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- HTML fallback -->
      <p class="font-monospace"><strong>Portfolio = Annual Expenses ÷ Safe Withdrawal Rate (4%)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> The total investment required to achieve financial independence.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual Expenses:</strong> Your expected yearly spending in retirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate:</strong> Percentage of portfolio you can withdraw each year without depleting it (commonly 4%).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This formula allows you to calculate your FIRE number. For example, if your annual expenses are $40,000, your FIRE portfolio would be:</p>
      <p class="font-monospace"><strong>Portfolio = 40,000 ÷ 0.04 = $1,000,000</strong></p>
      <p>With a $1,000,000 portfolio, withdrawing $40,000 per year would theoretically allow you to live indefinitely without running out of money.</p>
